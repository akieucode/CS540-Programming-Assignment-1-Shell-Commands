# CS540-Programming-Assignment-1-Shell-Commands

Implementing shell command system functions with C++ on Visual Studio.

In this program, you will only need to input numbers from 1-6. Any other numbers, letters, and symbols will be invalid and ignored.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPENING THE PROGRAM:
- Open the Visual Studio Solution file --> CS 540 - Assignment 1 - Amy Kieu.sln --> on the top left, press view "solution explorer" --> double click "CS 540 - Assignment 1 - Amy Kieu" --> go to the drop down arrow on source files --> double click "CS 540 - Assignment 1 - Amy Kieu.cpp"
- At the top in the middle, select --> Local Windows Debugger (to run the code)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program will display a menu with 1-6 options.

Option number [1] will display all the files that exist in the directory of this program.

Option number [2] will print out the current directory.

Option number [3] will create a "new_folder" on the initial selection. Additionally, I have also combined the remove directory function just to demonstrate that the user will try to delete "old_folder" but it will fail because it does not exist.

Option number [4] will display a working message.

Option number [5]
I have created two sample txt files called "File1.txt" and "File2.txt" that will be concatenated and display content within both files. Selecting this option will print out the txt file name, along with the content inside of it.

Option number [6] will no longer loop and exit the program.
